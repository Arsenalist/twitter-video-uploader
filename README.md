# Twitter Video Uploader

Check `config.toml` for the required configuration.

OBS must be outputting .mp4 files. If OBS is saving .mkv files then the Tweet functionality will not work as Twitter doesn't accept MKV. The save feature will still work.

OBS must have following shortcuts configured:

- Save Replay: CTRL+SHIFT+S
- Stop Recording: CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+E
- Start Recording: CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F

You must have OBS already recording, and a replay buffer must also be started before you start the program.  

`npm run start` to start
